## Summary
This method involves saturating the soil with water and subsequent extraction under partial vacuum of the liquid phase for the determination of dissolved salts. Soil moisture at the point of complete saturation is the maximum amount of water held when all the soil pore space is occupied by water and when no free water has collected on the surface of the paste. Over a wide soil textural range, the saturation percentage (SP) is approximately twice the Field Capacity (FC) or -33kPa soil water potential and is four times the Permanent Wilting Point (PWP) or -1500 kPa soil water potential for soils of loam, to clay loam texture. The soil pH may be determined directly on the paste. From the saturated paste extract, estimates of ECe, and solution concentrations of Ca^2+^, Mg^2+^, K ^+^,  Na ^+^, Cl ^-^, B, HCO~3~^-^, CO~3~^2-^, SO~4~ estimate (actual measurement is total S in extracts), SAR and ESP can be made. The method is generally reproducible within 8%.

## Summary
This method determines the pH of soil, using a saturated paste prepared from the soil and a pH meter. It is most applicable to soils with a pH ranging from 4.0 to 9.0. It is not possible to determine the total acidity or alkalinity of the soil from pH because of the nature of the colloidal system and junction potential. This method does however provide information on the disassociated H-ions affecting the sensing electrode. The method is generally reproducible within 0.2 pH units.

## Summary
This method determines the pH of soil, using an extract of a 1 to 10 dilution of soil with water and a pH meter. The pH of a soil sample increases with the degree of saturation (dilution effect). This rise in pH from pHs to pH 1+10 is usually 0.2 to 0.5 pH units but may be one or more units in certain alkaline soils where there is an increase in dissociation due to dilution of soluble salts.

## Summary
This method semi-quantifies the amounts of soluble salts in the liquid phase extracted from the saturated paste of soils and is based on the measurement of the electrical conductivity (ECe) of a saturated paste extract. The higher the concentration of salt in a solution, the higher will be the electrical conductance (the reciprocal of resistance). Electrical conductivity is a function of quantity and specific types of cations and anions in the extract. Plant tolerance can be related to the ECe value of the saturated paste. The method has a detection limit of approximately 0.01 dS m-1.

This method quantifies the amount of Cl^-^ in a soil water extract, such as from the saturated paste extract. Thiocyanate ion is liberated from mercuric thiocyanate by the formation of soluble mercuric chloride. In the presence of ferric ion, free thiocyanate ion forms the highly colored ferric thiocyanate, of which the absorbance is proportional to the chloride concentration. The absorbance of the ferric thiocyanate is read at 480 nm. Plant tolerance to chloride can be related to the concentration of chloride in the saturated paste extract. The method has a detection limit of 0.1 meq/L of Cl^-^ and is generally reproducible within 5%.

Sulfur results are assuming that all sulfur present is in the sulfate from. Sulfate uptake by plants can be related to the sulfate concentration in the saturated paste extract. Plant tolerance to soil boron can be related to the boron concentration in the saturated paste extract. K, Na, Ca and Mg are generally the dominant cations in the saturated paste extract of soils. Concentration of soluble Na, Ca, and Mg is used to determine the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of soils. Extract solutions containing greater than 10,000 mg/L (1.0% w/v, estimated from ECe) will require dilution since solutions of this salt concentration may impair instrument operation.

## Summary
This method involves the extraction of nitrate (NO~3~-N) and ammonium (NH~4~-N) from soils using an equilibrium extraction with 2.0 N KCl solution.  Nitrate is determined by reduction to nitrite via a copperized cadmium column.  The nitrite is then determined by diazotizing with sulfanilamide followed by coupling with N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride.  The absorbance of the product is measured at 520 nm.  Ammonia is determined by heating with salicylate and hypochlorite in an alkaline phosphate buffer.  The presence of EDTA prevents precipitation of calcium and magnesium. Sodium nitroprusside is added to enhance sensitivity.  The absorbance of the reaction product is measured at 660 nm and is directly proportional to the original ammonia concentration.  Extracts can be stored for up to three weeks at low temperature (<4Â°C) or frozen.  The method has a detection limit of approximately 0.10 ppm (on a soil basis). The results of analysis of un-dried soil are reported on a dry soil basis.

In cases of very limited sample amount, an alternative method maybe utilized. This method combines acid fumigation with a dynamic flash combustion system that is coupled with a gas chromatographic (GC) separation system and thermal conductivity detection (TCD) system.

## Summary
This method estimates the relative bioavailability of inorganic ortho-phosphate (PO4-P) in soils with neutral to alkaline pH.  It is not appropriate for soils which are mild to strongly acidic (pH <6.5).  The method is based on the extraction of phosphate from the soil by 0.5 N sodium bicarbonate solution adjusted to pH 8.5.  In the process of extraction, hydroxide and bicarbonate competitively desorb phosphate from soil particles and secondary absorption is minimized because of high pH.  The orthophosphate ion reacts with ammonium molybdate and antimony potassium tartrate under acidic conditions to form a complex.  This complex is reduced with ascorbic acid to form a blue complex which absorbs light at 880 nm.  The absorbance is proportional to the concentration of orthophosphate in the sample. The method has shown to be well correlated to crop response to phosphorus fertilization on neutral to alkaline soils.  The method has a detection limit of 1.0 ppm (soil basis).

This method estimates soil organic matter based on gravimetric weight change associated with high temperature oxidation of organic matter.  After initial oven drying at 105ÂºC, the samples are ignited in a muffle furnace for 2 hours at 360ÂºC.  The percent weight loss during the ignition step is reported as OM-LOI (% wt. loss) with a method detection limit of 0.05 %.  The calculation of organic carbon is based on the assumption that organic matter contains 58% carbon. 

Note:  To improve the accuracy of estimation of organic matter from loss-on-ignition data, it is recommended that a comparison study of OM by Walkley-Black and LOI be performed to determine the relationship between the two measurements.  The resulting equation can then be used for better estimation of organic matter from LOI values for similar samples.

## Summary
This method is based on the gravimetric loss of carbonates as carbon dioxide in the presence of excess hydrochloric acid. Major sources of error are: evaporation of water and failure to adequately degas CO~2~ from the sample. Soil carbonates are measured to determine soil buffering capacity with relation to soil fertility, chemical and pedogenic processes.  This procedure is an estimate of free calcium carbonate in the sample. This procedure does not adjust for magnesium, potassium, or sodium carbonates or organic matter which may be present.  The method detection limit is approximately 0.2% CaCO~3~ equivalent (on a dry soil basis).

## Summary
Buffer pH is the measure of a soilâs active and reserve acidity (i.e., buffer capacity) and is used to estimate lime recommendations.  The method is based on the Shoemaker, McLean and Pratt (SMP) method using the reaction of soil buffered acidity with a chemical buffer resulting in a change in the pH of the buffer.  This method is used for estimating exchange acidity including that associated with exchangeable aluminum.  Standard calibration curves exist for liming based on a SMP value to a desired pH for soil groups.  The lime requirement reported for this test is based on a desired pH of 7.0.  The result is reported in T/A/8in (tons per acre of 100% CaCO~3~ required based on an 8 inch furrow slice weighing 2.4 million pounds).  The table used is from Soil, Plant and Water Reference Methods for the Western Region, 2003.

## Summary
This procedure is performed on botanical materials (plant and feed) and miscellaneous samples such as manure to determine the moisture content of the sample as submitted.

Moisture is evaporated from samples in a forced-air oven at 55-60Â°C and Partial Dry Matter is determined gravimetrically as the residue remaining after oven drying. Some moisture remains in the sample because drying at this temperature does not remove all water. Drying at higher temperatures (greater than 60Â°C) causes chemical changes in the sample that affect subsequent testing. The Dry Matter test should also be requested if the total moisture content of the sample following drying at 105Â°C is required.

Partial drying of certain samples such as manure may not be compatible with subsequent analysis for constituents that might be volatilized or chemically or biologically transformed during drying.

Ammonium is determined by the diffusion-conductivity method based on the gaseous diffusing of ammonia (NH3) across a gas permeable membrane in the presence of excess base (KOH) and subsequent conductivity detection.  Nitrate is determined by first reducing it to ammonium using a copper-zinc reduction column and subsequent measurement as described above.  Concentrations of these nutrients are used to assess plant overall nitrogen status and are correlated to plant response to nitrogen fertilization.  The method detection limit is 10 ppm (dry basis).

High concentrations of ammonium can interfere with the nitrate quantitation. Volatile amines such as methylamine and ethylamine will interfere.

## Summary
Turbidity in water is caused by suspended and colloidal matter and is an expression of the optical property that causes light to be scattered and absorbed rather than transmitted. This method uses a nephelometer to measure turbidity. A nephelometer is a turbidimeter with a scattered-light detector at a 90Â° angle to the incident beam. Possible interferences with this method include floating debris and coarse sediment which settle out rapidly. Highly colored samples can give artificially low turbidity values. The method has a detection limit of 0.1 NTU.

This method quantitatively determines the amount of total carbon and inorganic carbon in liquid samples.  For total carbon, the liquid sample is injected by means of the integrated autosampler into the high temperature combustion reactor with an oxidative catalyst.  In this reactor, at the temperature of 850ÂºC all organic and inorganic carbon is oxidized into the gaseous carbon dioxide (CO~2~).  The catalyst that is present in the reactor catalyzes the oxidation to completion.  The carbon dioxide is measured at 4.2 um by infrared (IR) detection.  For inorganic carbon, a second injection of the sample is made into the low temperature liquid reactor.  In an acid medium and at room temperature, all inorganic carbon is oxidized to the gaseous carbon dioxide.  The flow of oxygen transports the carbon dioxide to the IR detector to be measured.  The method has a detection limit of 0.5 mg/L.

## Summary
This method involves the quantitative analysis of ammonium (NH~4~-N), nitrate (NO~3~-N) and nitrite (NO~2~-N) in water. Nitrate is determined by reduction to nitrite via a copperized cadmium column.  The nitrite is then determined by diazotizing with sulfanilamide followed by coupling with N-(1-naphthyl)ethlyenediaminie dihydrochloride.  The absorbance of the product is measured at 520 nm. Nitrite is determined in the same manner with the cadmium column off-line. Ammonia determined by heating with salicylate and hypochlorite in an alkaline phosphate buffer.  The presence of EDTA prevents precipitation of calcium and magnesium.  Sodium nitroprusside is added to enhance sensitivity.  The absorbance of the reaction product is measured at 660 nm and is directly proportional to the original ammonia concentration. The method has detection limits of approximately 0.05 mg/L for all analytes.

Note that the nitrate values reported include any nitrite in the sample. Nitrite is typically an insignificant fraction of the nitrate.
